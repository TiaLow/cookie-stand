Welcome to the Salmon Cookie project! A well-know Code 201 project. Below is a summary of the progression of the work. 

### Monday, June 8<sup>th</sup>
- Started with a very basic HTML scaffolding, knowing I'd need to spend most of my time work on the lists of data.
- I was undable to get the functionality of the lists workly exactly how I wanted, so would come back to this the following day. 
- Today was very challenging, and it set the tone for the next couple days!

### Tuesday, June 9<sup>th</sup>
- I revisted the list today and finished the JavaScript behind totalling the lists.
- Created the basic input for the fields, and managed to render main store data to the table. Wasn't able to sort out totals. 
- Worked on a little more CSS styling but decided to wait on doing too much for fear of having to fuss with it later. 

### Wednesday, June 10<sup>th</sup>
- Today was thankfully a bit of a 'catch-up' day, which I desperately needed to figure out the table functionality. 

### Thursday, June 11<sup>th</sup>
- Added the basic form input fields and worked on rendering information to table.

### Friday, June 12<sup>th</sup> to deployment on Sunday, June 14<sup>th</sup>
- In code review today, realized my numbers weren't updating correctly
- Went back to look at the code for this to fix it, with some direction from the discussion in code review.
- Cleaned up the JavaScript.
- Went back to basics for CSS and made a simple wireframe.
- Built the design with CSS, finishing touches.
